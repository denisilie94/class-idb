# Classification with dictionary learning and a distance barrier promoting incoherence (class-idb)


## Datasets

Most of the datasets are available [here](http://www.zhuolin.umiacs.io/projectlcksvd.html).

The action bank features can be downloaded from [here](https://cse.buffalo.edu/~jcorso/r/actionbank/).

We provide some extractors to organize the *HMDB51* and *UCF50* datasets as mat files efficiently.

## Reproducing the results

The proposed methods are available under the following scripts: *aksvd_idb_test.m* and *aksvd_itdb_test.m*.
